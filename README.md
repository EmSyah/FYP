The project titled "Indoor Receiver Optimization Based Visible Light Using Machine Learning Method" focuses on enhancing the performance of Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems utilized in indoor environments. The primary objective is to optimize the placement of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) which serve as both light sources and data transmitters to maximize the power reception of the signals.

The project employs optimization techniques, particularly Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA), to determine the most effective layout of LEDs. By improving the arrangement and distribution of these light sources, the project aims to achieve a more uniform distribution of received optical power, thereby enhancing the overall communication quality and coverage in indoor settings.

Additionally, by utilizing machine learning methods, the research explores ways to further optimize power management and improve the system's reliability. The findings could lead to more efficient indoor lighting and communication systems, leveraging the benefits of VLC technology, such as security, high bandwidth, and energy efficiency. Overall, the project contributes to the development of advanced strategies for optimizing indoor VLC systems. I used Kaggle as my platform to run this code due to its free cloud-based GPU/TPU support, built-in dataset hosting, and pre-configured Jupyter Notebook environment. Kaggle makes it easier to develop, train, and test machine learning models without requiring a local setup.
